# Eazi Ride

A ride hailing flutter app.

## How to run

Rename .env.sample to .env and fill in google api key. Run:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=.env
```

## Note
I used a file based DB stored in project root directory. This means the app can only be on Android Emulator and Xcode Simulator.
